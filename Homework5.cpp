/*
 Purpose: output the sum of the series X to the pow of 0 plus X to the pow of 1 plus X to the pow of 2 all the way to X to the pow of N. Both N and X being user inputs.
 
 input: N, and X.
 
 output: output the sum of the series X to the pow of 0 plus X to the pow of 1 plus X to the pow of 2 all the way to X to the pow of N.
 
 Algorithm: Create a user made function in order to calculate the sum of the series. Ask the user to input the X and the N for the sum series. Make sure the value of N is not less than 1. Call the series and use the user input in it. Output the function return.

 Function Purpose: output the sum of the series X to the pow of 0 plus X to the pow of 1 plus X to the pow of 2 all the way to X to the pow of N. Both N and X being user inputs.
 
 Function input: The user will input a double a and an intiger b.
 
 Funtion output: output the sum of the series X to the pow of 0 plus X to the pow of 1 plus X to the pow of 2 all the way to X to the pow of N.
 
 Function Algorithm: Create a loop and set count equal to 1, run whenever count is less than the input b, and add oune to count each time. In the loop equal double sum to sum plus term. and term equal term times a. Return the sum.
