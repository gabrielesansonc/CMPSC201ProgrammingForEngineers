% Purpose: Suppose a can of soda was removed from a refrigerator at a temperature of 38 degrees 
% and placed in a car sitting in the sun that maintains an interior temperature of 125 degrees. 
% Calculate the temperature of the can of soda for each time (from 0-3.5 hours in steps of 0.1), 
% to the nearest integer if k is 0.42. Plot the time vs temp. graph using linear scales for both axes; 
% a log scale for the y axis and a linear scale for the x axis; a log scale for the x axis and a 
% linear scale for the y axis; and a log scale for both axes.

% Input: Everything is already given, need the value of k, Temp object in farenheight, temp car in farenheight.
% 
% output: The temperature of the can for every time from 0-3.5 hours in steps of
% 0.1.
% 
% Algorith: Create an array for the time from 0-3.5 hours in steps of 0.1.
% Use the formula T = Ts+ (Toï¿½Ts)e^-kt to find temperature for every time.
% Store the time and temperature values in a 2d array. 
% Create a graph with x and y in linear scale.
% Create a graph with a log scale for the y axis and a linear scale for the x axis.
% Create a graph with a log scale for the x axis and a linear scale for the y axis.
% And one with log scale for both axes.


% None of the graph forms a perfect straight line.

% Input: Ask the user the type of conversion he/she wants to make. Ask the user the value to be converted.
% 
% Output: The user conversion of her given English unit with the actual metric unit.
% 
% Algorithm: Ask the user the what type of conversion he/she would like to convert: inches to centimeters, 
% quarts to liters, pounds to kilograms, miles to kilometers, or ounces to grams. Once he states the 
% conversion ask the quantity to be converted. If the quantity is less than 0 make him re-enter a value, 
% and a message telling him that negative numbers are invalid. If he chose inches to centimeters: 
% multiply by 2.54. If he chose quarts to liters: multiply by 0.95. If he chose pounds to kilograms: multiply 
% by 0.45. If he chose miles to kilometers: multiply by 1.61. If he chose ounces to grams: multiply by 28.35. 
% Then output the multiplication value.

% Purpose: Estimate the value of pi.

% y.
% 
% output: The estimated value of pi with 10000 points and with 1000000
% points.
% 
% Algorith: Create and array for x and one for y with 10000 numbers each.
% square each number in each array and add them up.
% create another array with the numbers less than of equal to 1.
% find the lenght of the array.
% Divide the lenght by 10000.
% multiply by 4 to find the approximation of pi.
% Create and array for x and one for y with 1000000 numbers each.
% repeat all the process for the points above.

% The true value of pi would be based of a sample size of infinite numbers.
% Generaly the bigger the sample size of points the more accurate
% aproximation of pi. This is why the aproximation when using
% 1000000 is most of the time closer to the actual value than the
% aproximation of 10000, and also why both values are different.
